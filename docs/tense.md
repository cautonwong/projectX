  A Casual Chat at the Park

  Characters:
   * Alex: (Sitting on a bench, looking a bit tired)
   * Ben: (Walking by, sees Alex)

  Dialogue:

  Ben: Hey Alex! You look tired. What are you doing here?
  Alex: Hi Ben. Yeah, I have been running for an hour. I just finished my workout.
  Ben: Wow, that's impressive! I was thinking about going for a run earlier, but then it started to rain.
  Alex: Oh, really? I had already left home when the rain began. Luckily, it had stopped by the time I
  reached the park.
  Ben: Good for you! I will probably go tomorrow instead. My friend, Sarah, will be joining me.
  Alex: That sounds nice. I will have completed my morning chores by then, so maybe I can join too.
  Ben: Great! By this time next month, I will have been training for a marathon for three months. It's a
  big goal.
  Alex: That's ambitious! If I had known you were so serious, I would have offered to train with you from
  the start.
  Ben: No worries. I would be running alone right now if you hadn't shown up. It's good to see you.
  Alex: Me too. I would have been working on my project all day if I hadn't decided to take a break.
  Ben: Smart move. I would go for a walk with you, but I have a meeting in five minutes.
  Alex: No problem. I will be resting here for a bit.
  Ben: Okay, catch you later!
